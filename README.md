# Laundry simulator

A component level simulation of a laundry washing machine using an object-oriented approach. The machine, which is constructed from a set of independent components, is able to remove various kinds of simulated dirt from different pieces of simulated fabric. The dirt is extracted from the fabric into the water and thrown out of the machine during washing. The system is theoretically extensible to allow for different types of household appliances.

The focus of this project is to construct a system of interfaces and classes which mimic concepts from the real world on a high level.
